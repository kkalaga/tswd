**Project Structure:**
- *Setup:* Global success, awards, certifications and acheivements of BTS. BTS are a global phenomenon.
- *Conflict:* Unnecessary hatred and stereotypical belittling comments against BTS sadlystill exists.  
- *Resolution:* Understanding what they represent and respecting them might be the only solution.

### 2. User Research Protocol
**Target audience:**
> People who are not BTS or K-Pop fans, do not respect artists that are not their favorite, has stereotypical ideas.

**Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:**
> Find people (who are not fans of BTS) of different ages and backgrounds so they have different thinking regarding boybands and artists.

**Interview script**
> Initially, I will start by showing them a picture of BTS (without telling them who they are) and ask for first impressions. This is to know how they feel about them and see if they change their opinions (if only they had bad first impressions.)

|**Goal**|**Questions**|
