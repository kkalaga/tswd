## Part 1
1. Outline
Summary: 
Come on a journey with me to know about BTS and how despite the amount of criticism, hate and belittlement, BTS and their fans ARMY have given each other strength and hope to succeed. "ARMY doesn't want to force everyone to like BTS. All the fans can hope is that others can respect BTS as artists and human beings."

Project Structure:
Setup: Global success, awards, certifications and acheivements of BTS. BTS are a global phenomenon.
Conflict: Unnecessary hatred and stereotypical belittling comments against BTS sadlystill exists.  
Resolution: Understanding what they represent and respecting them might be the only solution.

** put story arc here **

BTS is a South=Korean boy band that has become a global sensation. They are on top of the charts, broke numerous records and have one of the most loyal and dedicated fanbase called BTS ARMY (mostly referred to as ARMY or AMI). What makes BTS so big? Why are they compared to Beatles? What makes the relation between them and fans so special? Why are they so different from other artists?
