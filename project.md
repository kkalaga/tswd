#### Intended Audience:
The intended audience for this project are general public who might have hated other artists or celebrities or general public who want to know more about BTS than what is seen in the media. Especially targetted to those who are heavy social media users.

#### Project Summary:
The purpose of this project is to give a small glimpse of what any celebrity (BTS here) and their fans might go through because of hate that is throwm irresponsibly in social media and how they fight against it. But it also highlights how some of the hate could be much severe that needed and how important it is to prevent consequences because celebrities are also individuals and go through tough times.
